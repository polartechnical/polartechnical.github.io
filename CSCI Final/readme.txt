Hi Ajay!

The attached is a template of the Flask app we're going to build to control our hydrological simulator.  The general idea is an interactive, web-controlled sediment tank that allows users to scan a QR code from outside the Engineering lab window and create precipitation events that they can then watch.

There's a great deal of other information to add, as we'd eventually like this to be shared with the broader community and drive engagement to other departments in S&T.

This will be finalized later in the summer in consultation with the other Engineering faculty.

See you next week!
