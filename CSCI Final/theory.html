            <p>Physical groundwater simulators, often referred to as groundwater tanks or physical models, are experimental setups used to study and visualize the behavior of groundwater systems in a controlled laboratory environment. These simulators provide a hands-on approach to understand the complex processes of groundwater flow and aquifer behavior.</p>

            <p>The theory behind physical groundwater simulators is based on the principles of fluid mechanics, porous media flow, and scaled-down modeling. These simulators consist of transparent tanks or containers that represent aquifers, with materials such as sand, gravel, or soil serving as the porous media. The tanks are equipped with inlets and outlets to simulate recharge and discharge, and various instruments are used to measure water levels, flow rates, and pressures.</p>
            
            <p>By manipulating the inputs, such as recharge rates or hydraulic gradients, and observing the resulting groundwater flow patterns, researchers can gain insights into how aquifers respond to different conditions. These simulators allow for visual observation of phenomena like groundwater recharge, flow through different types of porous media, and the interaction between groundwater and surface water bodies.</p>
            
            <p>Physical groundwater simulators serve several purposes, including educational demonstrations, research investigations, and model validation. They can help students and researchers visualize abstract concepts, validate numerical models, and test hypotheses related to groundwater behavior under different scenarios.</p>
            
            <p>While physical groundwater simulators offer the advantage of direct observation and hands-on experimentation, they have limitations. Scale effects, boundary conditions, and the inability to fully replicate real-world conditions are factors that need to be considered when interpreting the results. Nevertheless, physical groundwater simulators provide a valuable complement to numerical models and field studies, allowing for a deeper understanding of groundwater flow processes and enhancing the overall knowledge of hydrogeology.</p>

            <p>The Groundwater Hydrology Simulator is an ENGR-212 semester project carried out by Patrick Goosen, Joshua Tandoc and Tyler Verbeek to demonstrate the impact of both environmental and human effects on the flow of groundwater through stratified layers of sediment.  The tank contains an upper layer of fine sand, a median layer of coarse sand, and a base of tight gravel separated from the sand by an impermeable layer of clay.</p>
